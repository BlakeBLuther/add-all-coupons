# add-all-coupons
Various services (such as grocery rewards programs) have an annoying habit of requiring you to log in to their website and "add" a coupon to your account 
before you can use it; it's not just automatically addd to your account like it should be.

These are just a colleciton of copypastable scripts that you can use to add all the coupons in one go. 

## To use

1. Log in to the program you want to use, navigate to the page to add the various coupons.
2. Copy the script for the service you want to use.
3. Open your browser's developer console (Firefox: `Ctrl+Shift+J` / `Cmd+Shift+J`, Chrome: `Control+Shift+J` / `Cmd+Option+J`)
4. Paste the script you copied into the console.
5. If you receive errors about pasting scripts, on Firefox type `allow paste` (no need to hit Enter) and try again.
6. Watch as the script adds all the coupons/items/whatever. :)
